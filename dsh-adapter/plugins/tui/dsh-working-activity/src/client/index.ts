/**
 * Working-activity surface plugin, browser half: the working-line entry in
 * the conversation.input.dock strip. This package's node half emits
 * `activity/status` session events; the web runtime patch narrows them into
 * the conversation snapshot's `activity` member, so this dock entry reads
 * the live frame through the standard session kit and owns no store, no
 * refresh chain, and no event listener.
 *
 * Mount contract (see the root README's "Web UI 集成" section): the web
 * client's client-modules host scans loader entries for `dsh.client`
 * declarations and serves this package's `./client` bundle at
 * /plugins/dsh-working-activity/client.js. The entry contributes into the
 * input dock — no official-source patch is involved.
