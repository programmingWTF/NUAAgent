/**
 * dsh-tui color themes — Gentle Mist Blue (雾蓝) family.
 *
 * Two truecolor palettes share one identity: mist blues carry brand, focus,
 * and interaction; body text stays neutral. `light` is the strict Gentle
 * Mist Blue card (warm off-white background #F6F3ED, ink text #343945) for
 * light terminals; `dark` is its dark-terminal adaptation (warm off-white
 * text, accent-soft blues). `dark-ansi` is the 16-color fallback for
 * terminals without truecolor. The active palette is chosen at startup by
 * querying the terminal background (OSC 11) — see ThemeProvider.
 *
 * `auto` is a pseudo-theme, not a palette: it resolves to `light` or `dark`
 * from the terminal background detected via OSC 11 (which tracks the system
 * theme in terminals that follow it). ThemeProvider re-runs detection every
 * time `auto` is selected and pushes the result through setAutoThemeBase(),
 * so getTheme('auto') always serves the currently detected palette.
