 * block cursor at the cursor position, and below it the slash-command
 * suggestion overlay (name column + description, selected row in the
 * `suggestion` color — mirroring Claude Code's PromptInputFooterSuggestions).
 *
 * Empty input: a solid block caret on a blank cell and nothing else — no
 * placeholder text, so the terminal-painted IME preedit (pinyin) at the
 * parked cursor can never be overlaid on anything.
 *
 * Multi-line: Shift+Enter inserts a newline; ↑/↓ move between lines while
 * the input spans multiple lines (history/command selection otherwise); the
 * visible window scrolls to keep the caret row on screen past
 * MAX_VISIBLE_LINES. Enter submits, backspace/delete edit, ←/→ move the
 * cursor, Tab completes the selected command, Ctrl+X opens the draft in the
 * external editor ($VISUAL/$EDITOR), Escape clears (or closes the help
 * menu), `?` toggles the help menu. Windows ConPTY pipelines deliver
 * whole lines with the Enter key lost: a trailing CR/LF in the input marks
 * a complete line to submit.
 *
 * Enter submits immediately even while the model is streaming — as a STEER
 * (Codex/pi semantics): the message is injected at the next step boundary
 * of the running turn and the agent continues without aborting; Tab instead
 * queues the message for after the turn (followup). Both appear in a
 * pending preview above the input until delivered. Alt+Up pulls the last
 * pending message back for editing; Esc (with pending messages while
 * working) interrupts the turn and delivers them right away; Ctrl+Enter
 * aborts the turn and sends the current input immediately.
