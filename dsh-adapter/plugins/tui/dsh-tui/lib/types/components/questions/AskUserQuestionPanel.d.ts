/**
 * The questionnaire panel — Claude Code style ask-user-question UI for the
 * DSH user-interaction seam. One question per panel (progress header, header
 * chip, wrapped question text, optional detail, option list with focus
 * pointer and multi-select checkmarks), styled in the dsh-tui mist-blue
 * design language.
 *
 * The list's last row IS the free-text input (issue #9): no Tab, no mode
 * switch — the view never changes. Typing while focused on a real option
 * appends into that input row (single-select also attaches the option's
 * label, so the answer can carry both `selected` and `custom`); focusing
 * the input row itself and typing gives a pure custom answer.
