 * preset with its display name and description, `❯` focus pointer and `✓`
 * on the preset the current session runs. Enter applies through
 * `channel.switchPreset`, Esc cancels. Broken presets are listed (the
 * roster's discovery contract) but marked with their reason; the roster
 * default is tagged.
