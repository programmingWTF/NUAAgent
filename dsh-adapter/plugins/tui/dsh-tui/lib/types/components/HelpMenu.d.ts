 * The `?` help menu, mirroring Claude Code's `PromptInputHelpMenu.tsx`
 * (three-column shortcut layout, trimmed to the keys dsh-tui actually binds).
 * The command column lists the merged slash-command surface: built-in
 * commands plus plugin-registered ones from the DSH registry (plan/goal/…).
 * Skill entries (user-invocable skills merged for `/` completion, issue
 * #86) are hidden — a skills directory can hold dozens of entries and the
 * menu is for chrome commands. Modifier labels follow the platform
 * convention: ⌘ on macOS, ctrl elsewhere.
