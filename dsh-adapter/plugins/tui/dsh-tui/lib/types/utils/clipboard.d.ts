/**
 * Cross-platform clipboard access for Ctrl+V paste. The TUI runs in raw
 * mode, so the terminal never performs its own paste for Ctrl+V — the key
 * arrives at the app and the clipboard is read here, per platform:
 *
 * - **Windows**: PowerShell `Get-Clipboard` (zero-dependency). File drops
 *   (Explorer copy) come back as a FileDropList, a raw image (screenshot)
 *   is saved as PNG via System.Drawing, anything else as text.
 * - **macOS**: `osascript` for files («class furl») and images («class
 *   PNGf»/«class TIFF», written to a temp file), `pbpaste` for text.
 * - **Linux/other**: the paste tools `wl-paste` (Wayland), `xclip` (X11)
 *   and `xsel` (X11, text only) are tried in session order until one
 *   connects — an installed tool whose session is unreachable (stale
 *   WAYLAND_DISPLAY/DISPLAY) falls through to the next candidate.
 *   `text/uri-list` offers become file paths, `image/*` offers are
 *   exported to a temp file whose path is inserted.
 *
 * Priority is always files → image → text (a screenshot copy offers only an
 * image; a file-manager copy offers a file list; everything else falls
 * through to text). Exported images go into a per-process private
 * directory (mkdtemp, mode 0700) under the OS temp dir and are created
 * with mode 0600 — clipboard screenshots routinely contain sensitive
 * content and must not be world-readable in a shared /tmp. The directory
 * lives until the OS cleans temp; files are referenced by the prompt as
 * paths, so they must outlive the read itself. When the directory cannot
 * be created (bad TMPDIR, permissions), an image offer degrades to the
 * text branch instead of failing the read — and the failure is not
 * cached, so the next paste retries.
 *
 * Text is base64-encoded on the PowerShell side so the line-oriented
 * stdout parse survives multi-line clipboard content (a raw write would
 * put every line on its own output line and drop all but the first); CJK
 * survives because base64 is pure ASCII. The Linux/macOS tools write raw
 * UTF-8 to stdout, which Node decodes directly.
