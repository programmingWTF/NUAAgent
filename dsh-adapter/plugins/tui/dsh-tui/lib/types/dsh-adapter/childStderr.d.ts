/**
 * Child-process stderr guard (issue #17).
 *
 * MCP servers spawned through `@nuaagent/mcp-client` run under the MCP
 * SDK's `StdioClientTransport`, whose stderr defaults to `'inherit'`
 * (`stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', server.stderr ?? 'inherit']`). An inherited fd 2
 * is written by the CHILD process straight to the terminal device — those
 * bytes never pass through this process's patched `process.stderr.write`
 * (see `ink.tsx` patchStderr), so they land at the parked cursor, scroll the
 * alt-screen, and interleave with the diff renderer's absolute-coordinate
 * writes. A server in a reconnect loop (e.g. a proxy repeatedly printing
 * `Error: Non-HTTPS URLs ...` + its usage line) turns that into the
 * overlapping garbage shown in the issue screenshot.
 *
 * The guard patches `child_process.spawn` and rewrites requests whose stderr
 * would be inherited (`'inherit'` as the whole-stdio string, stdio array slot
 * 2, or raw fd 2) to a pipe, then drains the pipe line by line into a sink.
 * Only fd 2 is touched; stdin/stdout keep their requested modes, so MCP's
 * JSON-RPC stdio channel is unaffected.
 *
 * Reachability note: the MCP SDK spawns via `cross-spawn`, which reads
 * `child_process.spawn` off the CJS exports object at call time, so this
 * patch covers it (verified by scripts/verify-child-stderr.tsx). A consumer
 * holding a snapshotted ESM named import (`import { spawn } from
 * 'node:child_process'`) would bypass the patch — no known consumer in the
 * dependency tree does that.
 */
/**
 * Take over inherited child stderr for the TUI's lifetime: any `spawn` whose
 * stderr would hit the terminal directly is piped and drained into `sink`
 * instead. Returns a restore function that reverts the patch; in-flight
 * children keep their (already piped) streams.
