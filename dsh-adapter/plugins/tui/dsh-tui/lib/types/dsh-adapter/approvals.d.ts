/**
 * Approval store — the UI-side answerer half of the DSH approval seam
 * (`ctx.approval`). The harness's permission layer asks
 * `ApprovalService.request()`, which dispatches an `approval/request`
 * waterfall; the listener registered in plugin.ts parks the request here,
 * surfaces one ask at a time to the TUI (Claude Code style permission
 * prompt), and settles the harness promise when the user decides, the
 * asker's abort signal fires, or the plugin tears down.
 *
 * Queue semantics mirror QuestionStore: parallel tool calls can trigger
 * several asks before any answer is given, so asks are drained FIFO.
 * Outcomes are the protocol's closed set — `'allowed-once'` and
 * `'rejected'` from the panel, `'cancelled'` on abort/teardown; there is
 * no allow-always or feedback channel in the protocol.
