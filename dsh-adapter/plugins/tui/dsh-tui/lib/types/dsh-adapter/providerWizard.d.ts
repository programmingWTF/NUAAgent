/**
 * `/provider` wizard — interactively adds an LLM provider route at runtime.
 *
 * The wizard is a sequence of `QuestionStore` asks (the same panel the
 * model-facing `ask_user_question` tool uses), so it needs no UI state of
 * its own. All side effects go through {@link ProviderSetupHost}, which the
 * channel implements over the dsh settings/credentials/llm seams:
 *
 *   profile → settings `llm-pi-ai.providers.<route>` (dsh-llm-pi-ai watches
 *             the section and registers the route without a restart)
 *   key     → credentials store (`~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml`, 0600), named by
 *             the derived `<ROUTE>_API_KEY` env-style ref the profile's
 *             `apiKeyEnv` points at
 *
 * The module is React-free so `scripts/verify-provider-wizard.mjs` can drive
 * it headless with a stubbed host and scripted answers.
