/**
 * Sync every preset directory under `sourceRoot` into `targetRoot` — the
 * dsh agent-presets discovery root (harness-home `.agent-presets`).
 *
 * A preset is a directory holding `agent.cordis.yml`; the directory name is
 * the preset id. Copy is per-directory and idempotent: a preset whose target
 * tree is byte-identical to the source tree is skipped, otherwise the source
 * tree is copied and any target files the source does not contain are removed.
 * Directories the plugin does not own (other presets the user authored) are
 * never touched.
 *
 * After a preset is synced its `agent.cordis.yml` is validated against the
 * structural preset schema; a validation failure is reported through the
 * run's `failed` entries instead of being a warn-only side effect, so callers
 * can observe (and surface) a broken preset rather than silently shipping it.
